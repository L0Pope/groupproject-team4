Changes this Update: The plan is to make a leaderboard that shows the information and score of the player. Before we were unable to implement 
allowing names and so there wasn't really any differentiation between scores. With these updates the user will be able to leave a username with 
the score and be able to see it on the leaderboard.

PseudoCode: The implementation will be adding variables to keep the user names and also adding a way to see if the h highscore is in the top 5. 
If it is then it will allow the user to enter a set of three letters as their username.

Issue Resolved: Now when there is a game over, you can see that there is a box to tell you to input your initials. When you click on it, you can 
type one character. You have to repeatedly click on the box in order to put multiple characters. In addition to this, when you click on the highscore 
screen you will see Initials of the top 5 in the leaderboard. The leaderboard will change if you beat one of the top 5 highscores and your initials 
you inputted will be there as well.
