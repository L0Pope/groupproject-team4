Changes this Update: The plan is to make a leaderboard that shows the information and score of the player. Before we were unable to implement 
allowing names and so there wasn't really any differentiation between scores. With these updates the user will be able to leave a username with 
the score and be able to see it on the leaderboard.

PseudoCode: The implementation will be adding variables to keep the user names and also adding a way to see if the h highscore is in the top 5. 
If it is then it will allow the user to enter a set of three letters as their username.
